# MFF (Made For Fun) license serie.
> Type: strict

> Version: MFF 1.0.0 (2024)

### Use and fork project:
1. Programs under this license can be forked by anyone, but the forked programs must be open-source.
2. Such projects can be used in the process of making close-source programs, but they cannot be part of it.
3. Forked projects cannot be sold or monetized even for premium accounts. (Voluntary donations are also welcome!)
4. In the forked project, the name of the project from which the idea was taken should be mentioned.
5. Open source projects under this license can be used in the development of closed source programs, but their names must be mentioned.

### Choose of developers and society:
1. No ethnic, sexual, age, religious or physical restrictions should play a role in the selection of developers.
2. A college degree and a resume are not good sources for hiring developers.
3. Programmers, regardless of their abilities, contribute to the development of the project.

### Project contributions:
1. All people in the project are equal. (Even the creator of the project)
2. Even if someone contributes a line of code or more to the development of the project, they are known as developers.
3. If people make voluntary contributions to the project, according to their consent, their names should also be announced.

### Project exceptions:
1. If a project has a legal problem and is removed from access, its forks will not be removed from access. Rather, they are known as forks of the previous project. (For example, project B is a fork of project A, and project C is a fork of project B. [A -> B -> C]. But if a legal problem occurs for project B and it is removed, then project C is known as a fork of project A. [A -> C])
2. If the license of the program is changed during the development, the forks of that project are known as the forks of the previous project.
